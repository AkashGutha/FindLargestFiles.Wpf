# FindLargestFiles.Wpf

I created this because I wanted an easy way to find the largest files in a directory. I use [TreeSize](https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/) already, and it works great. However, I think it's a bit complicated even so, with a very busy toolbar and not-very-obvious starting point. There are a lot of buttons that are not immediately obvious what they do, and a little piece of text tells me to look under a top level menu item to do something. Like I say it works fine when you actually use it, but I'm not wild about this UI.

I wanted something simpler, used async effectively, and that was written in WPF. I have not had a very good relationship with WPF, so anything I can do to make peace is a good thing.

My program works pretty much as I'd like. It's simple-enough by my definition, although the styling is quite primitive. Styling in WPF is certainly more powerful than in WinForms, but I still find WPF a bit difficult compared with CSS for the web. Anyway, that said, I have documented a number of issues I want to work on for this app, and welcome any contributions.
